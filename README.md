Matrix Meditation App
---Prototype 2014---
By Keenan Brugh

This application allows you to program your own mind. "Meta-programming", so to speak. It works by running through a shell command line
in a console/terminal window and printing out user-defined meditations mixed in with a flow of randomly-generated characters. 

The concept is combining inspirations from ancient cultural traditions (such as repeating mantras), to the more modern concepts of neurolinguistic programming and positive affirmations.(it is suggested to use short, present tense, positive, personal and specific statements) The printing will be scrolling up the screen quickly, and your brain will recognize the written pattern many, many times.

This app also lets you select a desired target brainwave frequency. (Simply affects the print rate)
For some examples, you can choose a relaxing 10Hz alpha state or an energizing 27Hz gamma state.

This app also accepts a timer variable for precise productivity.

Notes on the use of both ancient meditation and NLP techniques (which, sometimes fairly, have had critics call "pseudoscience"):
Ancient meditation practices, NLP and brainwave entrainment may or may not be as "effective" as others have claimed. However, this app does not make any medical or theraputic claims. Rather this app provides a tool for self-guided discovery and improvement. At the very least, placebos are a scientific reality, which is why the PLACEBO EFFECT MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT in scientific studies. Personally, I am a fan of science. However, if I were to entertain an counter perspective, it would be influenced by epistemological anarchism. As the scientific philosopher P.K. Feyerabend says in Against Method, "anything goes."
