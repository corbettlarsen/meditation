Matrix Meditation App
---Prototype 2014---
By Keenan Brugh

This application allows you to program your own mind. "Meta-programming", so to speak. It works by running through a shell command line
in a console/terminal window and printing out user-defined meditations mixed in with a flow of randomly-generated characters. 

The concept is combining inspirations from ancient cultural traditions (such as repeating mantras), to the modern 
neuro-linguistic programming concept of positive affirmations.(it is suggested to use short, present tense, positive, personal and specific statements) The printing will be scrolling up the screen quickly, and your brain will recognize the written pattern many, many times.

This app also lets you select a desired target brainwave frequency. (Simply affects the print rate)
For some examples, you can choose a relaxing 10Hz alpha state or an energizing 27Hz gamma state.
