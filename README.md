Matrix Meditation App
---Prototype 2014---
By Keenan Brugh

This application allows you to program your own mind. "Meta-programming", so to speak. It works by running through a shell command line in a console/terminal window and printing out user-defined meditations mixed in with a flow of randomly-generated characters. 

The concept is combining inspirations from ancient cultural traditions (such as repeating mantras), to the more modern concepts of neurolinguistic programming and positive affirmations.(it is suggested to use short, present tense, positive, personal and specific statements) The printing will be scrolling up the screen quickly, and your brain will recognize the written pattern many, many times.

This app also lets you select a desired target brainwave frequency. (Simply affects the print rate)
For some examples, you can choose a relaxing 10Hz alpha state or an energizing 27Hz gamma state.

This app also accepts a minutes variable for precisely timed sessions.

NOTES on the use of scientifically unverifiable techniques:

This app does not make any medical or therapeutic claims. Rather, the goal of this app is to provide a new tool for meditation, personal reflection and self-improvement.

Ancient meditation practices, neurolinguistic programming (NLP) and brainwave entrainment may or may not be as "effective" as some of their proponents have claimed. Some critics have accurately refuted certain claims, however, an outright dismissal of their potential by labelling them "pseudoscience" ignores the history of scientific discovery. Radical scientific discovery doesn't always fit neatly within existing paradigms. We might as well just play around!

At the very least, placebos ARE a verifiable reality. This is why the PLACEBO EFFECT MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT in scientific studies. 

Personally, I have always been a fan of the scientific method. However, when it comes to neurotechnology, let's all just admit we don't that much yet. If I were to entertain a perspective counter to mainstream science, it would be influenced by the ideas of epistemological anarchism. As the scientific philosopher P.K. Feyerabend says in Against Method, "anything goes."
