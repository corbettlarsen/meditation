Matrix Meditation App
---Prototype 2015---
By Keenan Brugh

"In the province of the mind what one believes to be true, either is true or becomes true within certain limits. These limits are to be found experimentally and experientially." 
        -Dr. John C. Lilly, author of Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer.

This application allows you to program your own mind. This "self-metaprogramming" works by rapidly cycling through user-defined meditations mixed in with a flow of randomly-generated characters. Use it on yourself to induce states of hypnotic relaxation or highly productive periods of focused thinking. 

For a visual example used alongside Junaid Kalmadi and Adam Hewett's Brain.fm for audio entrainment, wath this brief example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owbmMcK8pH4

The concept is combining diverse inspirations ranging from ancient cultural traditions (repeating mantras) to the more modern concepts of neurolinguistic programming (positive affirmations). The characters will be scrolling up the screen quickly, and your brain will recognize the written pattern many, many times. Thus, it is suggested you use short, present tense, positive, personal and specific statements. Some of my examples: "I am feeling relaxed." "Focus on being creative." or "Learn ______." while studying ______ on another computer monitor.

This app also lets you select a desired target brainwave frequency. For some examples, you can choose a relaxing 10Hz alpha state or an energizing 27Hz gamma state.

This app also accepts a minutes variable for precisely timed sessions.

NOTES on the use of scientifically unverified techniques:

This app does not make any medical or therapeutic claims. Rather, the goal of this app is to provide a new tool for meditation, personal reflection and self-improvement.

Ancient meditation practices, neurolinguistic programming (NLP) and brainwave entrainment may or may not be as "effective" as some of their proponents have claimed. Some critics have accurately refuted certain claims, however, an outright dismissal of their potential by labelling them as "pseudoscience" ignores the history of disruptive scientific discovery. Newly discovered realities don't always fit neatly within existing paradigms. Copernicus and Newton are perfect examples of this.

At the very least, we know placebos ARE a verifiable reality. This is why the placebo effect must be taken into account in scientific studies if they are to be generally accepted. 

Personally, I have always been a fan of the scientific method. However, when it comes to advancing neurotechnology, let's all just admit we are still in the early stages of gathering knowledge and trying things out. Why preclude the development of potentially paradigm-shifting tools just because we're still learning? If I were to entertain a perspective counter to mainstream science, it would be influenced by the ideas of epistemological anarchism. As the scientific philosopher P.K. Feyerabend says in Against Method, "anything goes."
