Matrix Meditation App
---Prototype 2015---
By Keenan Brugh

"In the province of the mind what one believes to be true, either is true or becomes true within certain limits. These limits are to be found experimentally and experientially." 
        -Dr. John C. Lilly, author of Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer.

This application allows you to program your own mind. This "self-metaprogramming" works by rapidly cycling through user-defined meditations mixed in with a flow of randomly-generated characters. Use it on yourself to induce states of hypnotic relaxation or highly productive periods of focused thinking. 

Watch this brief screen capture for a visual example of the Matrix Meditation App used alongside Junaid Kalmadi and Adam Hewett's Brain.fm for audio entrainment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owbmMcK8pH4

The main concept is combining diverse inspirations ranging from ancient cultural traditions (repeating mantras) to the neurological models of John C. Lilly to the more modern concepts of neurolinguistic programming (NLP). The characters will be scrolling up the screen quickly, and your brain will recognize the written pattern many, many times. Thus, it is suggested you use short, present tense, positive, personal and specific statements. 

This app also lets you select a desired target brainwave frequency. For some examples, you can choose a relaxing 10Hz alpha state or an energizing 27Hz gamma state.

This app also accepts a minutes variable for precisely timed sessions.

NOTES on the use of scientifically unverified techniques:

This app does not make any medical or therapeutic claims. Rather, the goal of this app is to provide a new tool for meditation, personal reflection and self-improvement.

Ancient meditation practices, neurolinguistic programming and brainwave entrainment have been studied with intriguing scientific results. That said, they may or may not be as "effective" as some of their proponents have claimed. People are often trying to sell something, and marketing can skew science. Some critics have accurately refuted certain claims, however, an outright dismissal of their fundamental potential by labelling everything as "pseudoscience" ignores the history of disruptive scientific discovery. Newly discovered realities don't always fit neatly within existing paradigms. Copernicus and Newton are perfect examples of this.

Additionally, at the very least we know placebos ARE a verifiable reality. This is why the placebo effect must be taken into account in many studies if they are to be generally accepted. 

Personally, I have always been a fan of the scientific method. However, when it comes to advancing neurotechnology, let's all just admit we are still in the early stages of gathering knowledge and trying things out. Why preclude the development of potentially paradigm-shifting tools just because we're still learning? If I were to entertain a perspective counter to mainstream science, it would be influenced by the ideas of epistemological anarchism. As the scientific philosopher P.K. Feyerabend says in Against Method, "anything goes."
