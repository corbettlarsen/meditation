Matrix Meditation App
---Prototype 2014---
By Keenan Brugh

This application allows you to program your own mind. "Meta-programming", so to speak. It works by running a shell command line
in a console/terminal window and printing out user-defined meditations mixed in with a flow of randomly-generated characters. 

The concept is combining inspirations from ancient cultural traditions (such as repeating mantras), to modern 
neuro-linguistic programming. By flashing by quickly, the idea is that your brain will recognize the written pattern 
many, many times.

This app also lets you select a desired target brainwave frequency. (Simply affects the print rate)
For some examples, you can choose a relaxing 10Hz alpha state or an energizing 27Hz gamma state.
