Matrix Meditation App
---Prototype 2015---

“Believe you can and you're halfway there.” 
        -President Theodore Roosevelt
        
"You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."
        -Marcus Aurelius

"In the province of the mind what one believes to be true, either is true or becomes true within certain limits. These limits are to be found experimentally and experientially." 
        -Dr. John C. Lilly, author of Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer.

Neural systems are naturally amazing at pattern recognition, and this program takes advantage of that. As a tool, it allows you to program your own mind. This "self-metaprogramming" works by rapidly cycling through user-defined meditations mixed in with a flow of encryption-grade random character generation. This tool serves as a nice way to set a mental intention, entrain towards a desired brainwave frequency, and it also comes with a timer to create an intentionally-set period of learning, relaxation, or productivity.

The main concept is combining diverse inspirations ranging from ancient cultural traditions (repeating mantras) to the neurological models of John C. Lilly to the more modern concepts of neurolinguistic programming (NLP) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). The characters will be scrolling up the screen quickly, and your brain will recognize the written pattern many, many times. Thus, it is suggested you use short, present tense, positive, personal and specific statements. If you go longer than a short sentence, try to make all the words fit appropriately enough any which way as your brain may be reading the words in a random order, depending on how fast you set your frequency setting. Questions are also highly effective as they prompt your mind for an answer.

==========

This app does not make any medical or therapeutic claims. Rather, the goal of this app is to provide a small contribution, a new tool for meditation, learning, and self-improvement.

Ancient meditation practices, neurolinguistic programming and brainwave entrainment have been studied with intriguing scientific results. That said, certain products out there may or may not be as "effective" as some of their proponents have claimed. People are often trying to sell something, and such incentives can skew science. Some critics have accurately refuted certain claims, however, an outright dismissal of all potential by labelling everything as "pseudoscience" in a reactionary, unsophisticated way ignores the history of disruptive scientific discovery. Knowledge can come from seemingly unscientific sources, and newly discovered scientific realities don't always fit neatly within existing paradigms. Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton are perfect examples of this.

Additionally, at the very least we know placebos ARE a verifiable reality. This is why the placebo effect must be taken into account in many medical research studies if they are to be generally accepted. 

Personally, I have always been a fan of the scientific method. However, when it comes to advancing neurotechnology, let's all just admit we are still in the early stages of gathering knowledge and trying things out. Why preclude the development of potentially paradigm-shifting tools just because we're still learning? If I were to entertain a perspective counter to popular science, it would be influenced by the ideas of epistemological anarchism. As the scientific philosopher P.K. Feyerabend says in Against Method, "anything goes."

NOTE:
This is my first "Hello, World" type program made while first starting to learn the Python programming language. Thanks for reading about it.
